# Study_Sphere_Spring_BackEnd

Welcome to the backend repository of Study Sphere, a full-stack project designed to enhance learning and study management. This repository houses the core server-side logic and APIs that power Study Sphere's functionalities.

## About the Project

Study Sphere is developed with a focus on providing a robust backend capable of handling various educational and study management tasks. The project is built using two primary Java build automation tools: Maven and Gradle. While development initially started with Maven, the focus shifted to Gradle mid-way due to its flexibility and performance advantages. Regardless, both versions are maintained to cater to diverse developer preferences.

### Tools and Environments

- **Maven**: Used in the early stages of development, with Eclipse as the primary IDE.
- **Gradle**: Chosen as the preferred build automation tool going forward, with development in IntelliJ IDEA. https://github.com/XiaoyangJin/Study_Sphere_Spring_BackEnd_Gradle
